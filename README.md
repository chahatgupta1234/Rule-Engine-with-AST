**Rule Evaluation Application**

Overview
The Rule Evaluation Application is a web-based tool designed to create, evaluate, and manage rules based on user-defined conditions. This application allows users to input various attributes such as age, department, experience, and salary, and evaluates rules accordingly. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), this application showcases effective rule parsing and evaluation techniques.

Features
Create Rules: Users can create complex rules using logical operators (AND, OR) and comparison operators (>, <, ==, etc.).
Evaluate Rules: Users can input personal data and evaluate selected rules to see if they hold true based on the provided conditions.
Manage Rules: The application allows users to view existing rules and select multiple rules for evaluation.
User-Friendly Interface: The application is designed with a clear and responsive UI, enhancing the user experience.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Styling: CSS
Installation
To run this application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/rule-evaluation-app.git
cd rule-evaluation-app
Install Dependencies: Navigate to both the frontend and backend directories and install the necessary packages.

bash
Copy code
# Backend
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
Environment Variables: Create a .env file in the backend directory and set the following variables:

plaintext
Copy code
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
PORT=5000
Start the Application: First, start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm start
Then, in a new terminal window, start the frontend application:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
Open the Application: Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

Usage
Create a New Rule:

Navigate to the "Create Rule" section, enter the rule string in the provided format, and submit to create a new rule.
Evaluate a Rule:

Select a rule from the dropdown list and input the required attributes (age, department, experience, salary). Click on "Evaluate" to see the result.
View Existing Rules:

The application displays a list of all created rules in the "Rule List" section.

Security and Performance Considerations
Input Validation: Ensured user inputs are validated before processing to prevent injection attacks.
Error Handling: Added error handling mechanisms for API requests to enhance application robustness.
Environment Variables: Sensitive information such as database connection strings is stored in environment variables.
Future Enhancements
Implement user authentication to manage rules for different users.
Add a feature to export rules in various formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).
Improve UI responsiveness for mobile devices.
